## 🏗️ Architecture

This application follows Clean Architecture principles with a feature-based folder structure:

```

├── core/                    # Core utilities and constants
│   ├── constants/          # App-wide constants
│   ├── error/              # Error handling and failures
│   └── utils/              # Utilities and extensions
├── features/               # Feature modules

│   └── widgets/           # Reusable widgets
└── main.dart              # App entry point
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **BLoC Pattern**: For state management and business logic separation
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Flutter's provider system
- **Observer Pattern**: For reactive UI updates
- **Command Pattern**: For user actions and events

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (for testing)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### State Management with BLoC

```dart
// Example: Cart BLoC implementation
class CartBloc extends Bloc<CartEvent, CartState> {
  CartBloc() : super(const CartInitial()) {
    on<AddToCart>(_onAddToCart);
    on<UpdateCartItem>(_onUpdateCartItem);
    on<RemoveFromCart>(_onRemoveFromCart);
  }
  
  void _onAddToCart(AddToCart event, Emitter<CartState> emit) {
    // Handle adding items with quantity and special instructions
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

```dart
// Comprehensive error handling with custom failures
abstract class Failure extends Equatable {
  final String message;
  const Failure(this.message);
}

class NetworkFailure extends Failure {
  const NetworkFailure(super.message);
}
```

### Mock Data with Realistic Behavior

```dart
// Simulated network delays and occasional failures
@override
Future<List<Restaurant>> getRestaurants() async {
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 800));
  
  // Simulate occasional network failure
  if (DateTime.now().millisecond % 20 == 0) {
    throw const NetworkException('Failed to fetch restaurants');
  }
  
  return _restaurants;
}
```
